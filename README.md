## Purpose

- As a previous salesman having worked for both domestic and foreign brands, I realized alot of people do not know what to expect when they decide they want to buy a new car and step foot in the dealer. My goal in this application was to give a few insightful tips of what to expect to do when someone plans there next visit to a dealer and once they are at the dealership. 

## What I learned

- I learned how to build an app from scratch using Next.js. It was a really fun experience and want to continue exploring all the cool technology that Next.js has to offer. I learned alot about Next.js serverside rendering and how Next.js enables the developer to select the pre-rendering structure of the application or each of its pages. 
" Server side rendering is something where HTML is created on every request, meanwhile, static generation helps produce HTML at the build time, which can be reutilized on every request." - Next.js 

## Getting Started
