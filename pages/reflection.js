              I do not have a sales article, guide or lighting talk that really left a huge impression on me.
              There are two books that really helped me floursih in my sales career: 
              The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz and Selling 101 by Zig Ziglar

              These books really helped me gain the confidence I needed early in my sales career to grow into the Professional, well-rounded salesperson I am today. The Four Agreements taught me 
              how to to not take things personally, being confident and impeccable with my word and always striving to do my best.

            I was inspired by Selling 101 to consider every prospective customer as a stage. If a prospect found my presentation amazing, the possibility of converting a prospect to 
            a client would significatly rise. This book taught me the importance of actively listening to prospects and how to prepare my mind to envision the result I wanted from 
            my sales presentations.
